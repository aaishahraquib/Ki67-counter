# Ki67-counter
This tool is an open-source and freely available, validated application created to provide a more accurate, time-efficient, and user-friendly method to automate Ki-67 quantification in meningiomas.
The Ki67 counter was validated using 61 meningioma images at 10x magification.
The results yielded automated counts that predicted the manual counts significantly better than the two manual counts predicted each other.
I would love to expand this application to different brain tumors if it becomes useful for the clinical community.
Publication pending. Please contact me at aaishah.raquib@gmail.com with any questions or comments.

The code is implemented in the following web app: http://ki67.app
